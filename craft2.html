        <h2>Bandhani</h2>

        <p class="Gujarat">
            Bandhani is a traditional Indian textile known for its vibrant patterns and unique 
            tie-dye technique. It primarily consists of lightweight fabrics like cotton, silk, or 
            muslin. Artisans meticulously fold and tie the fabric using threads before dyeing it to 
            create intricate, colorful designs. The making of Bandhani involves a detailed process of 
            plucking the fabric with fingernails into many tiny bindings that form a design. Each section 
            of the fabric is then tied with thread to resist the dye. After tying, the fabric is dyed, and 
            the ties are later removed to reveal the pattern.

        <h2>Patola</h2>
        <img id="Gujarat" src="Patola.jpg">
        <p class="Gujarat">
            Patola is a double ikat woven sari, usually made from silk. The dyeing and weaving process 
            uses natural dyes, including indigo, turmeric, and madder. Known for its vibrant colors and 
            elaborate designs, Patola is highly prized and often worn on ceremonial occasions. Patola is 
            crafted using a resist dyeing technique called double ikat. Each silk thread is precisely 
            dyed before weaving to create intricate patterns. This labor-intensive process can take 
            months to complete.

        <h2>Gharchola</h2>
        <img id="Gujarat" src="Gharchola.jpg">
        <p class="Gujarat">
            Gharchola is a traditional textile often made from silk or cotton fabric, characterized by 
            its grid-like patterns. These grids are embellished with elaborate designs using zari 
            (gold thread) or silk embroidery, making the fabric vibrant and rich in appearance. It starts 
            with the dyeing of the fabric, followed by the application of wax-resist methods or block 
            printing to create intricate designs. Afterward, the fabric is often adorned with bandhani 
            work, a form of tie-dye, which adds texture and depth to the design.
