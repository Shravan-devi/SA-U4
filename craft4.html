                Pani Gamcha is crafted mostly  from cotton, which is highly valued for its 
                breathability and absorbency. This material makes the gamcha lightweight and suitable 
                for the hot and humid climate present in many parts of India. The Pani Gamcha holds 
                significant cultural value in India, particularly in rural areas. It is commonly used 
                as a versatile piece of fabric that serves as a towel, scarf, and sometimes even clothing.
                The creation of such craft involves several traditional weaving techniques. The cotton 
                yarn is first spun and then dyed using natural or synthetic colors depending on regional 
                practices.
