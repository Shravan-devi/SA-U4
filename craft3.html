            <h2>Kantha Embroideries</h2>
            <p>
                Kantha Embroidery is a traditional form of hand stitching from Eastern India and 
                Bangladesh, primarily using layers of old saris or soft dhotis. These textiles are 
                stitched together with colored threads pulled from the borders of the used garments. 
                Kantha holds significant cultural value as it represents the resourcefulness and 
                artistic expression of rural women. Traditionally made by women as a form of leisurely 
                art or for practical purposes, it symbolizes warmth, protection, and blessings. To create
                this textile craft involves a simple running stitch along the edges. Artisans begin by 
                layering several old fabrics, which are then secured together. The stitching follows 
                intricate patterns, often inspired by nature, folklore, and everyday activities.

            <h2>Taant</h2>
            <p>
                Taant is an Indian textile craft renowned for its weaving style, primarily involving 
                cotton fibers. It is especially prominent in West Bengal and Bangladesh. These textiles 
                are celebrated for their lightness and comfort, making them particularly suitable for 
                the hot and humid climate in these regions. It is made through a detailed process of 
                weaving, which begins with the spinning of cotton into yarn. The yarn is then dyed using 
                traditional techniques and set up on a handloom. Weavers use a variety of weaving 
                patterns to create distinctive motifs and borders characteristic of Taant sarees.
