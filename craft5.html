            <h2>Kalamkari</h2>

            <p>
                Kalamkari is a traditional form of hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile. It 
                primarily uses natural dyes derived from minerals, plants, and roots. The cotton fabric 
                is treated with solutions like buffalo milk and myrobalan nuts to ensure that the dyes 
                adhere properly and the colors stay vibrant. This textile craft holds great significant 
                cultural value in India, embodying centuries-old artistic traditions. Originating in Andhra 
                Pradesh and Telangana, it is integral to religious and mythological storytelling. Each piece 
                serves as a canvas depicting Hindu deities, scenes from epics like the Mahabharata and 
                Ramayana. The Kalamkari process is intricate and involves up to 23 steps. It starts with 
                the cotton fabric being soaked in a mixture of cow milk and myrobalans, which help in 
                fixing the dyes. Artists then sketch motifs using a bamboo or date palm stick pointed at 
                one end with a bundle of fine hair attached. This tool is dipped in natural dyes and used 
                to paint the fabric. Depending on the detail and colors required, the fabric may undergo 
                multiple washings.

            <h2> Batik</h2>
            <img class="S" src="Batik.jpg">
            <p>
                Batik is primarily made using fabric, typically cotton or silk, which serves as a canvas 
                for intricate patterns. Batik holds substantial cultural significance in India, 
                reflecting traditional aesthetics and regional artistic identities. It is celebrated 
                for its craftsmanship and the preservation of age-old techniques. The process begins 
                with stretching the fabric on a frame. Melted wax is then applied to areas of the fabric 
                that the artisan wishes to keep undyed. After the wax solidifies, the fabric is dipped in 
                dye; the waxed areas resist the dye and remain the original color. This can be repeated 
                with multiple layers of wax and shades of dye to add more colors. Once dyeing is complete
                , the wax is removed by boiling or scraping the fabric, revealing the pattern.
