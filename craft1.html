            <h1 class="title">Rajasthani Textile Crafts</h1>
            <p>Rajasthan is very well known for their wonderful textile crafts.
                These products may be quilts or blankets or patterns themselves.
                Here are some of the most important Textile crafts in Rajasthan:
            </p>
            
            <h2>Jaipuri Quilts</h2>              
            <p class="Rajasthan">
                Jaipur quilts are renowned for their incredible lightness and warmth. 
                Typically they're made from high-quality cotton or silk fabrics, filled with finely 
                carded cotton that is locally sourced. The outer layers often feature vibrant,
                traditional Rajasthani prints or delicate block patterns. The process of making a Jaipuri
                quilt begins with the preparation of the filling, which involves thoroughly cleaning the 
                cotton to ensure it is fluffy and free of impurities. Artisans then skillfully layer the 
                cotton between two pieces of fabric, often silk or cotton, chosen for their softness and
                durability. The quilt is stitched together using a traditional technique called "tagai".
                This stitching is not just functional but also artistic and patterns that are specific to
                the artisan's community. The entire process is labor-intensive and requires a high level of skill.

            <h2>Kota Doria</h2>              
            <p class="Rajasthan">
                Kota Doria is a type of Indian fabric known for its unique open weave structure and 
                lightweight texture. Typically used in sarees, dupattas, and scarves, it is admired for
                its softness and elegance.Kota Doria is crafted from fine threads of cotton and silk.
                The unique blend of these materials results in a fabric that combines the lightness and 
                comfort of cotton with the subtle sheen and strength of silk, making it ideal for warm 
                climates. The making of Kota Doria involves a meticulous process of spinning cotton and 
                silk threads, which are then woven on traditional pit looms. The distinctive square 
                check pattern, known as 'khat,' is achieved through a technique called resist-dyeing, 
                ensuring precision and uniformity.
